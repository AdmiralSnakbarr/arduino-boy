# Arduino-boy

For if you don't have friends that still play first generation Pokemon games.

I liberally borrowed code form [gameboy-spoof](https://bitbucket.org/adanscotney/gameboy-spoof) to the point where it's basically an Arduino port.

Use his script to generate `output.h` in case you want to trade more than just Articuno.
